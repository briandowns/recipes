## Directions

* Sterilize everything that will come in contact with the cider
* Fill pot with 1 gallon of apple juice
* Add 1/4 cup of light brown sugar
* Add 1 3/4 teaspoon caramel flavor oil
* Soak pecans in bourbon for 30 minutes. Strain. Add to food process and pulse. Add back to bourbon and let soak in.
* Add pecans to a frying pan and cook slowly to cook off the boubon and toast
* Lay on paper towels and dry out
* Add 1/2 lb of pecans
* Simmer for 20 minutes
* Let cool back down to room temperature
* Strain out pecans
* Add must to the primary fermentation bucket
* Take an initial gravity.  This reading should be around 1.066. 
* Add the airlock and place in a cool dark place

## After about 2 weeks...

* Siphon contents from the primary fermentation bucket into another vessel though only take the liquid
    * There could be up to an inch of sediment at the bottom.  Itâ€™s dead yeast, yeast nutrient, and other things you don't really care about.
* Add more water or vodka to a cleaned and sterilized airlock on the secondary carboy
* Let sit for another week.
* Bottle condition or put under CO2 pressure.
    * If put under CO2 pressure, I'd recommend 15 psi

The cider is ready to drink once carbonated however it's best when aged. Try to let it sit for at least a month but better for 2+ months.
