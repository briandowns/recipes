# Mulled Hard Cider

## Materials

| Item | Quantity |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| large pot | 1 |
| 1 gallon carboy | 2 |
| rubber stopper with airlock | 1 |
| funnel | 1 |
| large spoon | 1 |
| measuring spoons | |
| hydrometer | 1 |
| wine thief | 1 |

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| yeast - dry ale | 8.625g |
| apple juice | 1 gallon |
| peptic enzyme solution | 2 drops |
| dark brown sugar | 2 cups |
| Brewcraft yeast nutrient | 1 teaspoon |
| mulling spices | 8 tbs |

## Directions

* Sterilize everything that will come in contact with the cider
* Fill pot with 1 gallon of apple juice
* Add 2 cups of dark brown sugar
* Add 8 tbs of mulling spice
* Simmer for 20 minutes
* Let cool back down to room temperature
* Add must to the primary fermentation bucket
* Take an initial gravity.  This reading should be around 1.089. The final gravity reading will be around 1.001 depending on temperature of fermentation which will be ~11.5% ABV.
* Add the airlock and place in a cool dark place

## After about a week...

* Siphon contents from the primary fermentation bucket into another vessel though only take the liquid
    * There could be up to an inch of sediment at the bottom.  Itâ€™s dead yeast, yeast nutrient, and other things you don't really care about.
* Add more water or vodka to a cleaned and sterilized airlock to the secondary carboy
* Let sit for another week.
* Bottle condition or put under CO2 pressure.

The cider is ready to drink once carbonated however it's best when aged. Try to let it sit for at least a month but better for 2+ months.

# Future Notes

* This cider comes out semi dry and could be backsweatened.  It's not entirely necessary though.
* Serving warm allows the cider to take on additional flavors
