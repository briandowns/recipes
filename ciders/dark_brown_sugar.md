## After about a week...

* Siphen contents from the primary fermentation bucket into another vessel though only take the liquid
    * There could be up to an inch of sediment at the bottom.  Itâ€™s dead yeast, yeast nutrient and other things you don't really care about.

The cider is ready to drink once carbinated however it's best when aged. Try to let it sit for at least a month.
