## Directions

* Sterilize everything that will come in contact with the mead
* Fill pot with ½ gallon of water and honey
* Heat up **SLOWLY** to 140F for 20 minutes, stirring all the while
* In the small bowl, pour half a cup of room temperature water and add the yeast
* Use a teaspoon to **GENTLY** stir the water and yeast combination
* Let yeast and water sit for 15 minutes
* Skim off any foam from the top of the pot
* Let the pot cool to room temperature
* Using the funnel, pour the must into the carboy
* Add 20 - 30 raisins into the carboy
* Add orange slices (⅛ slices) into the carboy
* Add more water until almost full
* Close carboy with solid rubber stopper
* Shake **GENTLY** for 10 minutes
* Add more water leaving room for later bubbling
* Using the funnel, pitch the yeast
* Close carboy with solid rubber stopper
* Shake gently, even **MORE GENTLY** than last time
* Fill airlock halfway with water and the close carboy
* Place in a cool dark place

## In 30 days...

* Siphen contents from one carboy to another (racking) only take the liquid
	* Leave the oranges, raisins, etc
	* There could be up to an inch of sediment at the bottom.  It’s dead yeast.  Don’t try to get all of the liquid as this may result in getting some of that sediment
* Add more water to the airlock if necessary and transfer to the other carboy
* Let sit for 6 - 9 months
* Bottle and serve!
