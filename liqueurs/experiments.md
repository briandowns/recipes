# Experiments

These experiments are a result of buying too many peices of fruit and not wanting them to go to waste.

## Experiment 1

This was inspired by a number of cocktail recipes I had found online that called for gin in small quantities to offset some other flavors.  I thought I'd cut to the chase and include gin as part of the steeping process.  For this experiement, I used 3 oz of gin; 2 oz 50 Pounds and 1 oz Hendricks.  The vodka is Seagrams Extra Smooth.

### Directions

* Clean the lemons and grapefruit with a vegetable bruch under cold water.
* Put the vodka through the filter at least 4 times to smoothen out the taste.  Nothing needs to be done with the gin.
* Zest the lemons and grapefruit and place the zest in a large bowl.  Once done, put into final bottle.
* Pour the vodka and gin into the bottle.
* Cover and mix the zest and liquor combination
* Let stand for 2 in a cool, dark location.

#### After 2 weeks...

* Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil for 15 minutes and then allow to cool to room temperature.
* Pour syrup into liquor and zest mixture.
* Cover and mix again.
* Let stand for 4 weeks in a cool, dark location.

#### Serving

* Take mint and basil and muddle.
* Pour 4 oz into a shaker with ice and shake.
* Add ice to a glass, add mint and basil and then pour shaker in.
* Add club soda OR tonic.
* Garnish with a lemon twist.
