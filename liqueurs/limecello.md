# Limecello

| Ingredient | Quantity | 
| ------------- | ----------- |
| limes | 20 | 
| Seagram's Extra Smooth Vodka | 1 liter |
| sugar | 2.25 cups | 
| water | 3 cups | 

Let stand for 14 days.

In a large pot, bring the water to a boil and add in the sugar. Bring it back up to a boil and continue to boil until the sugar is dissolved. Let this sugar water cool completely.

Meanwhile, you can strain the lime zest from the alcohol. Pour the steep alcohol first into a strainer, placed over a bowl, to remove the zest. Then run the limecello through coffee filters, three to four times, to remove the finer particles of peel. This is best done with flat-bottomed coffee filters (but I had none in the house – it still worked out though!).

Straining the liqueur will make your limecello clear and avoid any sediment on the bottom of your drink. You can also strain your water/sugar mixture one or twice when cool to ensure a clear final product.
Once both your liquids are at room temperature and strained, mix the two together to make your limecello complete! Take a shot and make sure it’s just what you wanted! If you tend to like stronger liqueurs, you may want to add the simple syrup a few cups at a time, tasting along the way. Alternatively, if you like sweeter drinks, adding more water/sugar will make the limecello a great cocktail mix..
Store your limecello in a cool place like a cellar or a fridge. It is best served right out of the freezer as a after-dinner aperitif, over ice cream or use it as an ingredient in desserts.
