# Tangelocello

We were given tangelos by a lady at my wife's ranch.  I had no idea what to do with them so natural I thought, make liquor!

## Ingredients

* 22 small tangelos or 14 regular size (lemon sized)
* 1 liter Seagram's Extra Smooth Vodka
* 1 Brita filter pitcher
* 1 1/4 cups white sugar
* 2 cups water
* bottles and corks
* some sort of strainer (screen, cheesecloth)


## Directions

* Clean the tangelos with a vegetable bruch under cold water.
* Put the vodka through the filter at least 4 times to smoothen out the taste.  
* Zest the tangelos and place the zest in a large bowl.  Once done, put into final bottle.
* Pour 1 liter of vodka into the bottle.
* Cover and mix the zest and vodka.
* Let stand for one 1 in a cool, dark location.

### ...after a week...

* Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil for 15 minutes and then allow to cool to room temperature.
* Pour syrup into vodka and zest mixture.
* Cover and mix again.
* Let stand for 3 weeks in a cool, dark location.

### ...after 3 weeks...

* Strain the tangelocello using your choice of strainer.
* Bottle the liqueur.
