# Limoncello

This recipe is based on a recipe given to me by my father-in-law Bill Broadbent.

## Ingredients

* 14 lemons
* 1 liter Seagram's Extra Smooth Vodka
* 1 Brita filter pitcher
* 1.5 cups white sugar
* 2 cups water
* bottles and corks
* some sort of strainer (screen, cheesecloth)


## Directions

* Clean the lemons with a vegetable brush under cold water.
* Put the vodka through the filter at least 4 times to smooth out the taste.  
* Zest the lemons and place the zest in a large bowl.  Once done, put into final bottle.
* Pour 1 liter of vodka into the bottle.
* Put the lid on the bottle and shake to mix the vodka and zest.
* Let stand for one 1 week in a cool dark location.

### After 1 Week

* Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Boil for 15 minutes and then allow to cool to room temperature.
* Pour syrup into vodka and zest mixture.
* Put the lid on the bottle and shake again to mix the syrup with the rest of the vodka and zest.
* Let stand for 3 weeks in a cool dark location.

### After 3 Weeks

* Strain the limoncello using your choice of strainer.
* Bottle the liqueur.
