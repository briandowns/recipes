## Directions

### Prep

* Porcini - put in 3 cups of hot water to rehydrate
* Mushrooms - clean and slice into even sides pieces
* Onions - dice into 1/4" pieces
* Garlic - smash and lightly chop
* Chives - chop and put aside

### Cooking

* Put the chicken stock in a pot at low heat.

* Add olive oil to a large sauté pan over medium-high heat and add the garlic.  Sauté until the garlic begins to brown.  Remove from the heat and throw away the garlic but keep the oil in the pan.  Add the mushrooms to the pan and sauté until the mushrooms become soft.  Save for later use.

* Remove the porcini mushrooms from the small pot of water and make a puree with a little bit of the water from the pot.  If you don't have a food processor, you can use an immersion blender in a container that won't cause a huge mess when turning the blender on.

* Generously add olive oil to another pot at medium-high heat and add the onions.  Season with salt and stir.  Once the onions have become soft, add the rice and let cook for 2 to 3 minutes to toast the rice, stirring often.  Add the wine while stirring until completely absorbed.  At this point, you can add some of the water from the porcini pot but make sure not to get any of the sand or dirt from the bottom.

* Add chicken stock enough to cover the rice.  Stir often until the stock is absorbed.  You'll need to repeat this process 2 - 3 times all while checking your seasoning and adjusting as necessary.

* On the last round of stock addition, add the sautéed mushrooms and the porcini.  When the stock has absorbed, verify the rice is done and remove from the heat.  Add the butter and cheese and stir until the rice is creamy. 

### Presentation

* Garnish with a little extra parmigiano cheese and the chopped chives.
