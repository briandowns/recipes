## Pasta Directions

* Dough: Sift flour, salt, and pepper together.  Place flour mixture on a board, making a well in the center of the flour. Drop eggs into the flour well, using your hand or a fork, break the yolks and beat eggs slightly. Combine the eggs and flour together, gradually adding enough warm water to make a stiff dough.  Knead dough well, until smooth; cover the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes.  Cut dough in half and roll each half of the dough out on a floured board, into a very thin sheet (about 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick).
* Filling: Drop about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls of filling about 1 1/2 inches apart all along the dough.  When the sheet of dough is fully dotted with dabs of filling mixture, cover filling with other sheet of dough.  Using your fingers, gently press dough between each dab of filling to seal it.  Cut ravioli into squares with a (zig-zag edged) pastry cutter, or very sharp knife.
* Drying: Allow ravioli to dry for one hour before cooking.
* Cooking: Drop ravioli into 6 to 8 quarts of boiling, salted water and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until dough is tender.  Remove cooked ravioli from pot carefully with a skimmer or a large slotted spoon, and drain well.  Place drained ravioli on a serving platter in layers, alternating layers with your favorite sauce and a sprinkling of grated cheese between each ravioli layer.

## Filling Directions
