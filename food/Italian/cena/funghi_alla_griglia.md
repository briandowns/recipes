# Funghi alla Griglia

| Ingredient | Quantity | 
| ------------- | ----------- |
| portobello mushrooms | 3 |
| spaghetti | 1 lb |
| sauce | 1 jar of arribiatta | 
| garlic | 6 cloves |
| basil | 4 large leaves | 
| olive oil | to taste | 
| salt | to taste |
| pepper | to taste |

## Directions

### Prep

* Lay the mushroom caps upside-down and remove any lingering pieces of stem from the portobellos and pull off any of the loose edges.
* Lightly salt and pepper the mushrooms followed by a drizzle of olive oil.
* Chop the basil and place on the mushrooms.
* Chop and crush the garlic until you have an eventual paste.  With your fingers, place the clumps onto the mushrooms and smear the garlic all around.
* Put another drizzle of olive oil on the mushrooms and place in the refridgerator for a few hours.

### Cooking

* Brush grill top with olive oil and heat up.  When ready, place the mushrooms on the grill with the seasoned side up.  Flip when ready.  Cook for however long you like portobellos cook for. I'd recommend at least long enough until each side has a nice char.
* Cook pasta to taste.
* Heat up sauce in a medium sauce pan.

### Presentation

* Space a medium portion of spaghetti on the center of the place.  
* Add half a ladel of sauce.
* Place one or tow whole basil leaves off to the side of the sauce circle for partial covering by the mushroom.
* Place a portobello on top.
* Add a little more sauce to the center of the portobello.
* Sprinkle some graited paramasan cheese.
