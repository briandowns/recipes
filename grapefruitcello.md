# Grapefruitcello

## Ingredients

* 12 grapefruits 
* 1 liter Seagram's Extra Smooth Vodka
* 3 cups water
* 2 cups sugar

## Directions

* Dump the zest into a bottle and pour the vodka over it. 
* Seal with a lid and store in a cool and dark place. 
* Steep the zest for at least 6 weeks until the zest turns white and brittle.

* To make the simple syrup, combine the water and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and stir until the sugar is dissolved. 
** Let cool to room temperature before using.  Pour half of the grapefruit-infused vodka into the same bottle, then fill each jar.  
** No need to fuss with the zest for now; just let them sit until the liqueur is ready to be strained.
* After 2 weeks (or even longer for better flavor), strain and bottle for serving.
