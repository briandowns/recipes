# Grapefruitcello

## Ingredients

* 12 grapefruits 
* 1 liter Seagram's Extra Smooth Vodka
* 3 cups water
* 2 cups sugar

## Directions

* Dump the zest into a 32-ounce jar and pour the alcohol over it. 
* Seal with a lid and store in a cool and dark place. 
* Steep the zest for at least three weeks (if using Everclear) or six weeks (if using vodka) until the zest turns white and brittle.

To make the simple syrup, combine the water and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Let cool to room temperature before using.
Pour half of the lemon-infused alcohol into a second jar (or reuse the empty Everclear bottle), then fill each jar with an equal amount of simple syrup. No need to fuss with the zest for now; just let them sit until the liqueur is ready to be strained.
After one to two weeks (or even longer for better flavor), strain both jars of citruscello through a fine mesh sieve into a large pitcher, then strain again through an ultra fine sieve (like a gold coffee filter or several layers of cheesecloth) as you pour the cello back into the mason jars. You’ll fill each jar just over halfway full; add more simple syrup if you like it a little sweeter, but I recommend waiting at least a month for the flavor to mellow out before you decide how much more to add. You might not need to at all, and in the meantime, you can use the potent “young” cello as a mixer.
Store the cello in the freezer and serve in chilled glasses for a refreshing digestif, or stir into champagne or gin for a boozy cooler.
